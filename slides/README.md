# NPFL114 (Deep Learning) Slides

The NPFL114 (Deep Learning) slides can be viewed in any modern browser (with
Chrome and Firefox tested).

You can either see the slides
[http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~straka/courses/npfl114/1718/slides/](on-line at ÃšFAL),
or locally -- but in that case you need this directory to be served by a real
web server for the AJAX requests to work. The easiest is probably to run
```
python3 -m http.server
```
