- Policy Gradient Methods [Chapter 13, Sections 13.1-13.5 of [Sutton's Book](http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2017nov5.pdf)]
- Policy-gradient (aka REINFORCE) Reinforce Learning Algorithm [Algorithm in Section 13.3 [Sutton's Book](http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2017nov5.pdf); note that the *gamma^t* on the last line should not be there]
- REINFORCE with Baseline Reinforce Learning Algorithm [Algorithm in Section 13.4 [Sutton's Book](http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2017nov5.pdf); note that the *gamma^t* on the last line should not be there]
- Actor-Critic Reinforce Learning Algorithm [Algorithm in Section 13.5 [Sutton's Book](http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2017nov5.pdf); note that the *gamma* on the last but one line should not be there]
- *Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (aka A3C) Reinforce Learning Algorithm [[Volodymyr Mnih et al.: Asynchronous Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01783)]*
