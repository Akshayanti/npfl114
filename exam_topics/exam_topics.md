Generally, only the topics covered on the lecture are part of the exam
(i.e., you should be able to tell me what I told you). The references
are to Deep Learning Book, unless stated otherwise.

- Computation model of neural networks
    - acyclic graph with nodes and edges
    - evaluation (forward propagation) _[Algorithm 6.1]_
    - activation functions _[`tanh` and `ReLU`s, including equations]_
    - output functions _[`σ` and `softmax`, including equations (3.30 and 6.29);
      you should also know how `softmax` is implemented to avoid overflows]_

- Backpropagation algorithm *[Algorithm 6.2; Algorithms 6.5 and 6.6 are used in practise,
  i.e., during `tf.train.Optimizer.compute_gradients`, so you should understand the idea
  behind them, but you do not have to understand the notation of `op.bprop` etc. from
  Algorithms 6.5 and 6.6]*

- Gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent algorithm _[Section 5.9]_

- Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) principle _[Section 5.5, excluding 5.5.2]_
    - negative log likelihood as a loss derived by MLE
    - mean square error loss derived by MLE from Gaussian prior _[Equations (5.64)-(5.66)]_

- _In addition to have theoretical knowledge of the above, you should be able to
  perform all of it on practical examples – i.e., if you get a network with one
  hidden layer, a loss and a learning rate, you should perform the forward
  propagation, compute the loss, perform backpropagation and update weights
  using SGD. In order to do so, you should be able to derivate softmax with NLL,
  sigmoid with NLL and linear output with MSE._

  write the algorithms down and understand motivations behind them)_:

    - SGD with Nestorov Momentum _(and how it is different from normal momentum)_ _[Section 8.3.3 and Algorithm 8.3]_

      gradient distribution, AdaGrad effectively decays learning rate)_
      _[Section 8.5.1 and Algorithm 8.4]_
    - RMSProp _(and why is it a generalization of AdaGrad)_ _[Section 8.5.2 and Algorithm 8.5]_
